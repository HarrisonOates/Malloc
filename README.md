# MyMalloc

This repository hosts:
- An explicit, multiple free list malloc implementation with constant-time coalescing (in mymalloc.c); and
- A conservative mark-and-sweep garbage collector (in mygc.c)

Both `malloc` and the GC passed all marking test cases, which alongside the report gave me a high-range HD for the assignment.
I keep my files as submitted for posterity.
